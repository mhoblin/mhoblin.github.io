				<div class="content active">
					<p>I have been a dedicated fine artist since childhood. In 2012, I changed my focus to visual communication design with an emphasis in fine arts in order to utilize my passion for art as well as my new interest in graphic design. From the freelancing jobs from word of mouth, to the tedious work I do in school, I am working hard to build a portfolio so that I can expand my career options in the visual communication design field. I am an organized and responsible worker with the persistence and patience to create something new. When working with a team or working alone, I will develop a consistent plan to attain the goals my teammates and I have projected to our client. </p>

					<p><strong>Eastern Washington University: 2012 - present.<br>BFA of Visual Communication Design<br>Current Standing: Senior</strong></p>

					<p>"The Department of Engineering and Design and the Department of Art offer an intercollegiate Visual Communication Design Program founded on four major concerns: developing the highest levels of individual creative performance and professional education; providing courses for all students which develop ability in both technical visual communications as well as important core skills in the area of fine art; giving students a greater cultural and historical understanding and aesthetic appreciation of the function of design in the arts and in the world around them; and functioning as dual centers of emphasis and resource for the visual arts, visual communication and technology in the cultural activities of both the university community and the community at large.Both departments are committed to working together to give students access to current technologies in the area of graphic design, as well as experience in developing the necessary visual skills provided by studio art areas such as drawing, painting and sculpture." </br></br>-extract from ewu.edu on the BFA in VCD</p>

					<p><strong>MMC of Eastern Washington University: 2012 - present</br>
					Lead MultiMedia Computer Lab Consultant</strong></p>
				

					<p>This job has my co-workers and I constantly in training and training each other. The MMC is a limited resource for students with multi-media projects (video, photography, identity package design, web-design, printing, etc). We are constantly helping students with their projects, most of which involve the Adobe CC Applications. In order to be the best use to the students who come into the lab for our assistance, we make sure to stay up to date in the technology world. We are taking Lynda courses (lynda.com) as we encounter new problems, so we are constantly upgrading our personal ranges of software, print, and design knowledge.

					<p><strong>Wolff Hislop and Crockett: 2014 - present</br>
					Consultant and Designer</strong></p>
					<p>I am currently a consultant for Jamie Wolff. I teach him how to use computer programs including iPhoto and iMovie, as well as building his knowledge of his hardware and software wherever he feels the need to learn. I am designing the brochures for his commercial real estate agency and taking photos of his buildings. Recreating vector floor-plans of each suite is another project I have taken on. For his Law Firm, Wolff Hislop and Crockett PLLC, I designed a logo, style-guide and letterhead. Every project that comes his way that may require a designer or creative thinking, I'm there to take it on.</p>
