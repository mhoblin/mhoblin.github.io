				<h2 class="ten wide column">Visual Communication Designer / Fine Artist
				</h2>
				<p>I have been a dedicated fine artist since childhood. In 2012, I changed my focus to visual communication design with an emphasis in fine arts in order to utilize my passion for art as well as my new interest in graphic design. From the freelancing jobs from word of mouth, to the tedious work I do in school, I am working hard to build a portfolio so that I can expand my career options in the visual communication design field. I am an organized and responsible worker with the persistence and patience to create something new. When working with a team or working alone, I will develop a consistent plan to attain the goals my teammates and I have projected to our client. </p>

The MMC is a limited resource for students with multi-media projects (video, photography, identity package design, web-design, printing, etc). We are constantly helping students with their projects, most of which involve the Adobe CC Applications. In order to be the best use to the students who come into the lab for our assistance, we make sure to stay up to date in the technology world. We are taking Lynda courses (lynda.com) as we encounter new problems, so we are constantly upgrading our personal ranges of software, print, and design knowledge.</p>
